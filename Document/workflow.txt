ðŸ”¹ Activity 1: Poultry Blood Cell Classification using HematoVision

Objective:
Leverage deep learning and transfer learning techniques to classify various types of poultry blood cells for early disease detection in veterinary diagnostics.

Work Done:

Explored research papers and medical resources to understand the significance of poultry blood cell morphology in detecting infections.

Chose a pre-trained deep learning model (Transfer Learning - MobileNetV2) to improve classification efficiency on limited dataset sizes.

Designed and trained a model to recognize four types of blood cells: eosinophils, lymphocytes, monocytes, and neutrophils.

Developed a Flask web app (HematoVision) for real-time image upload and classification.

Integrated frontend (home.html, result.html) with backend predictions using a trained .h5 model.

Built a responsive UI with custom image carousel and prediction result view.

Outcome:

Achieved high accuracy in classifying poultry blood cells, enhancing the diagnostic process.

Created a user-friendly, deployable tool (HematoVision) to assist researchers and veterinarians.

Demonstrated the potential of AI in veterinary hematology and diagnostic automation.
